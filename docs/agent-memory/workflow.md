# NINA Agent Workflow

## Branch and PR Discipline
- **No direct commits to main.** `main` is the production-truth desk and must stay clean.
- Every active local executor or Jules task gets its own worktree/branch.
- Local executor default territory: `docs/space/*.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `nina_context.md`, `*.sh`, and single-file hotfixes on files not claimed by Jules.
- Jules default territory: multi-file work in `core/*.py`, `tools/*.py`, `interfaces/*.py`, `tests/*.py`.
- Shared but sequential only: `requirements.txt`, `data/*.json`.
- Forbidden parallel territory: `.env`, secrets, lock-sensitive runtime files.

## Sync Behavior
- **NINA Sync blocking:** Must block/defer pushes when Jules PR branches are open; prune stale remote refs before checking.
- The local executor runs `./nina_sync.sh` to deploy and export after every Jules PR merge.

## Rebase-Before-Work Rules
- Always rebase on origin/main before starting Jules tasks: `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main`.

## Agent Coordination
- Local agents and Jules must NEVER edit the same file simultaneously.
- `jules_lock.txt` must always be read from and updated at the main worktree path: `~/nina/jules_lock.txt`.
- Per-task file territory must be explicit before parallel work begins.
